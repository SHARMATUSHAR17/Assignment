           1. Which of the following is NOT a component of the CPU?

    as.    2) RAM


          2. What is the function of RAM in a computer?

          => 1) Temporary Storage: RAM holds data and instructions that the CPU needs while performing tasks.
               This allows for quick access and processing.

             2) Speed: Because RAM is much faster than traditional storage (like hard drives or SSDs), 
                it enables the CPU to retrieve and write data quickly, improving overall system performance.


          3. Which of the following is a primary storage device?
 
          4)  1 and 2 both
           => HDD AND SDD


          4. What is the purpose of a GPU?
          
          =>  GPU is primarily to handle and accelerate the rendering of images,videos,and animations for display.

          5. True or False: The motherboard is the main circuit board of a computer
           where other components are attached.

          => True 


          6. True or False: A UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) is a hardware
             device that provides emergency power to a load when the input power
             source fails.
 
          => True 


           7. True or False: An expansion card is a circuit board that enhances the
              functionality of a component.

           => True

          8. Explain the difference between HDD and SSD.

          => HDD (Hard Disk Drive) and SSD (Solid State Drive) are both types of storage devices used in computers,
             but they differ in several key areas:

             HDD: Utilizes spinning magnetic disks (platters) to read and write data. 
                  A mechanical arm moves the read/write head across the platters.

             SSD: Uses flash memory chips (NAND) to store data, which allows for faster data access and retrieval.
                  There are no moving parts in an SSD.

             HDD: Generally slower due to mechanical movement, resulting in longer boot times and slower file transfers.

             SSD: Much faster, offering quicker boot times, application loading,
                  and file transfers because it accesses data almost instantly.



          9. Describe the function of BIOS in a computer system.

          => Power-On, Boot Loader,  Hardware Initialization, Basic Input/Output Services, Time and Date



          10. List and briefly explain three input devices commonly used with
              computers.

          =>   Keyboard, and  Mouse

            1) Keyboard

               A keyboard is a primary input device that allows users to enter text, numbers, and commands into a computer. 
               It consists of keys for letters, numbers, and various functions.

            2) mouse 
                
               A mouse is a pointing device that allows users to interact with the graphical user interface (GUI) of a computer. 
               It typically has two buttons and a scroll wheel.

         11. Identify and label the following components on a diagram of a
             motherboard:

           1. CPU Socket (Central Processing Unit Socket)
              .  Description: The socket where the processor (CPU) is installed. It’s typically square or rectangular with a series of pins or pads.
              .  Location: Usually located near the top-center of the motherboard.
            
          2. RAM Slots (Memory Slots)

             . Description: Long, rectangular slots where the system memory (RAM) modules are inserted.

             .Location: Typically found near the CPU socket. 
          
         3. PCIe Slots (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) 
              
            . Description: These slots are used for adding expansion cards such as graphics cards (GPU), sound cards, network cards, and storage controllers.

            . Location: Usually located along the bottom or center of the motherboard


        12. Demonstrate how to install a RAM module into a computer.

           1. Power Down the Computer:

             .Turn off the computer and unplug it from the power source. This is crucial to avoid electrical shock or damaging the components.


             . Press the power button for a few seconds to discharge any remaining power from the capacitors.

           2. Prepare the Workspace:

             .Clear the area where you’ll be working. Ensure the surface is clean and static-free.

             . Use an anti-static wrist strap (if available) to protect the internal components from electrostatic discharge
   
           3. Open the Computer Case:

             . Use a screwdriver (if necessary) to remove the screws securing the side panel of the case. Most cases have one side that slides or lifts off.

             . Remove the side panel carefully and set it aside.

          4. Locate the RAM Slots:

             . Identify the RAM slots on the motherboard. These are long, rectangular slots usually located near the CPU socket.

             .If your motherboard has multiple RAM slots, check the user manual to see the optimal slots to use for a dual-channel configuration

          5. Prepare the RAM Module:
